Background
==========

Recently Samsung announced [BLE SDK](http://developer.samsung.com/ble) for supporting their devices to communicate 
with 'Smart' device using bluetooth low energy protocol. However, the support is only limited to their mobile devices
running with Android 4.2.x (Level 17). To my best knowledge, Galaxy S4 is the only one comes with 4.2 which means the current main trend devices including Galaxy S3, Note 2 (currently latest official update is Jellybean 4.1.x - Level 16) won't be able to get the support at this point. It really depends on when Samsung will push out update for these 'old' devices to make them work with latest SDK.

With an assigned task, I started to exploit BLE support on Android. Before this, I had no knowledge at all on Android
development. I did some iOS development with the BLE stack provided by Apple though. Unlike the case with Apple, I found out
that there is no standard support for BLE in Android world. Instead, vendors provides their own support for their own
devices. Motorola has their [API](http://www.motorola.com/sites/motodev/library/bluetooth_apis.html) but I don't know if
it still works with the latest version of Android OS since I don't have the device to test. HTC includes BLE support in 
their [OpenSense SDK](http://www.htcdev.com/devcenter/opensense-sdk) which seems get most support among others since
[Bluetooth.org](http://bluetooth.org) has chosen it as the Smart-Ready device for Android development in their [BLE development kit](http://developer.bluetooth.org/DevelopmentResources/Pages/Quick-Start-Kit.aspx).
But here we focus on the test devices I got.

Difference on S3 and S4
=======================
What I got for test developement are both coming from Samsung who claims has the most market share in Android world, 
the Galaxy S3 (SGH-I747) and Galaxy S4 (I9500). I got the S3 with contract upgrade from AT&T last year (Sorry for leaving
Apple, but S3 was way cheaper than iPhone 5 at that time and I wanted to save the cost) and got the S4 recently for the test 
developement. Although APIs on both the platforms are provided by Samsung they are using different stack underneath (mentioned in their BLE SDK API Guide). 

S3's API was developed based on stack from [Bluez](http://www.bluez.org/). I guess HTC's APIs is also based on Bluez but not sure.

S4's API is developed based on stack from Broadcom called Bluedroid. I guess the reason why Samsung made this change
is because Samsung's mobile devices rely on Broadcom's bluetooth chip and Broadcom claims to 
[provide their bluetooth stack in Android 4.2 for free](http://www.broadcom.com/press/release.php?id=s721534).


Reason why I dig out the APIs on S3
===================================
Of course the first reason is because I want to have the little board built from our lab with TI's CC2540 BLE chip talk to not only S4 but also S3 that I have. Indicated from the SDK API Guide Samsung provided on their SDK website, they provided the API that works with Bluez stack in the past which they called verion 1.0. And now the APIs on S4 is 2.0. However, I couldn't find the place where they used to release their API with version 1.0. In fact, I saw developers kept asking for it from the time Galaxy S3 was introduced which claims Smart-Ready.

Clues from Play Store
=====================
Fortunately, I found out some apps on play store that make use of the BLE API from Samsung such [Bluetooth Smart Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.semilink.smartscanner&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5zZW1pbGluay5zbWFydHNjYW5uZXIiXQ..) and [Pebble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.semilink.pebble.pxpmain&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5zZW1pbGluay5wZWJibGUucHhwbWFpbiJd) from Semilink, and [nRF utility](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nordic.nordicbleapp&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5ub3JkaWMubm9yZGljYmxlYXBwIl0.) from nordic. It shows me that the API must have been published, but probably not publicly. I don't know whether those company who got the API has contract with Samsung or something. But I decided to get the API out and give it a try.

Getting the API out
===================
All I want to do is the jar file of Samsung's API which they claims to have provided before. To respect others work I only share the compiled API jar here and make a test app by my own.


Several things to be clarified before jumping to my sample code:
================================================================
1. I am a newbie in Android. Here I am just trying to share what I knew and what I learned. Please let me know if anybody discover any bugs on my code. I am sure most people who saw this repo are way better than me on mobile app development. I like to see your comments.
2. The code is tested with EcoBT board designed at [UCIrvine Embedded System Lab](http://embedded.ece.uci.edu/) using TI's CC2540 chip. It probably won't work out of box with your board since yours might have different service profile implemented. You can just pick up the logic inside and try to make an app with your own board by specifying different services and characteristics. You can also contact me if you have questions. I will try to answer questions as I can.
**However**, due to variation of boards people may use I probably won't be able to answer all the questions regarding your BLE devices. One option to consider is to get a board we designed from us for better and native support. Please contact with my professor, Professor Pai Chou at ecowsn@gmail.com **if and only if** you are interested in obtaining a board from us for further developement/collaboration for academic/industrial projects, or if you just want to have a real hardware to test the code.
3. Please contact Samsung if you are trying to use the API on a commercial product as I don't know whether the API comes with a license or not. Please take your own risk if you are not letting them know.
4. If you are looking for a sample code which works out of box with the 'Keyfob' from TI, please to repo from [here](https://github.com/cjhuo/Android-App-for-Keyfob-Demo-From-TI).


Things to pay attention
==================================
1. Unlike 2.0 which rely only ```BluetoothGatt``` profile class for connecting LE devices, in 1.0 it also override the standard ```BluetoothAdapter``` and ```BluetoothDevice``` classes for LE devices discovery and connection status checking. So make sure you put the API jar file at the top order in 'Build class path' so that the system will use the classes in the jar instead of the standard classes.
2. Implement your own BLE Service profiles by extending ```BluetoothLEClientService``` and put them into an ``` ArrayList```. And extends ```BluetoothLEClientProfile``` to register these service profiles using ```BluetoothLEClientProfile.registerLEProfile(arrayListOfServiceProfiles)```.
3. 1.0 rely on bonding to connect LE device. Make sure you create a bond with the device first and make sure the bond state is ```BluetoothDevice.BOND_BONDED``` before you call ```BluetoothLEClientProfile.connectLEDevice(LEDevice)```.
4. Have fun!

Video Demos
===========
1. Here is the short video demo to show communication between Galaxy S3 and the board from our lab. The board is designed based on TI's CC2540 BLE chip and has a built-in accelerometer and many other features and great scalability with an easy-to-use interface. In the video it demonstrates the capability of connecting to an ECG board also designed by our lab to do remote controlling and monitoring of human ECG recording (Yes, there are actually 2 tiny boards in side the small black box for this job!).

Problems & Fixes 
===================================================
1. (Updated 06/07/13) One thing that I found out is everytime the phone is trying to bond with LE device, The 'Bluetooth Pairing Request' window gets poped up which never happens in API 2.0 (Well, 2.0 has its own problem though...).

- Fix: The problem is caused by a parameter of GAP Bond Manager from firmware settings. To avoid the passkey request pop-up windows, you can disable the pairing from your firmware side. For example, if in your firmware you set the paramter like ```GAPBondMgr_SetParameter( GAPBOND_PAIRING_MODE, sizeof ( uint8 ), &pairMode );```, then you should change the value of ```pairMode``` to ```GAPBOND_PAIRING_MODE_NO_PAIRING (0x00)```. Flash your device with new firmware and try to connect with the S3. You won't see the pairing windows any more when connection is being established. This solution only works with device built with TI's CC2540 chip.

(Please report any problem you found and suggest any solution you know!)

Thanks to the great tool [dex2jar](https://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/), with which I have managed to get the API out.
